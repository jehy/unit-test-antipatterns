# Skipped tests

Sometimes you have to make a quick fix and the only way to pass CI is to skip some bothering
test. And it seems fine.

It seems fine until you discover that you have 2000 skipped tests, and no one knows if
those should work and why they were disabled.

When you skip tests - leave a comment, why you did it, and create a task to repair tests.

Skipped test is a dangerous and dead code which is only a burden.
