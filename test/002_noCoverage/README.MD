# No coverage

If you never read about test coverage - take a minute
and [check wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage).

Of cause, even 100% coverage does not assure that your code is flawless
and will work in all circumstances.

But that is many times better then not knowing your coverage at all.
