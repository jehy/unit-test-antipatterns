# No tests on Continious Integration

Even if you write tests - it is almost useless if you don't run them.

You should run them on commits, on publishing modules, on push, on build... Any time
when you are about to make some change. Only then you will gain all the profit.

Remember - tests which are not launched are just a dead code.
