# Using date in future

Sometimes you have to use date based approach - for example, when you
store data in different storages based on date, or when laws change, or
when you need to apply discount on special date and etc.

There are often cases when you need to check if date is passed, it is current
or it is in the future.

And you have to remember that time does not stop, and any date will happen eventually.
And it will break you tests.

At least you can set future date to something far away like 2050 - and let your ancestors deal with it XD
